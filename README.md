# HWDetCS
The C# version of a new project I'm working on!
What this does, is show you information about the hardware you are running this program on.

## FAQ (not really, no one has asked me anything about this yet, I just find this is the best way to explain certain things)

#### Q: But a lot of programs already do this... and they are better than yours... why are you making this?
A: Great question! The goals and advantages of this project are this:
1. Its open source! You can see exactly what results you are getting and how! Numbers aren't very useful if you don't know where they came from or what they mean!
2. Its designed to be more user friendly, things like CPU-Z look old and might scare a new user, and Task Manager isnt much better. That said, for the Advanced users out there, I won't give you a lack of information! If you see something missing that you want added to the list of detections, just ask!
3. I need experience on working on/actually finishing projects, which is one of the reasons why I wont be making this same exact program just once, but 3 times, I'm doing it in C# first because C# is what I am most comfortable with. Is that a big goal and am I in way over my head? Yep! Am I gonna let that stop me? Nope!
4. I plan on also releasing an API based on this code so that you can make your own version! So if you know what to do and dont wanna talk to me, you can make your own functionality using the same base used here, and as an added bonus, you won't have to pull your hair out trying to figure out what my code does/means!

#### Q: What can I do to help?
A: Im not currently looking for any help, I guess the best thing you could do to help would be the following:
1. Report bugs!
2. Suggest Features (I want it to be to the point where I need to make a Trello board!)
3. Test my stuff! If stuff breaks tell me about it! If it does something really weird, TELL ME! PLEASE!
4. Suggest ways to help improve my code! I can't learn without criticism! If I'm doing something completely wrong and dumb, tell me so I can do it the right way!

#### Q: When will this be done?
A: I have no clue!
